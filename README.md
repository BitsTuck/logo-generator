App demo: 

## Description

The Challenge for Module #10 asked us to create a logo generator using Node.js and testing with the Jest Node package. In order to demonstrate functionality, we were to provide a screencast, since we are not tasked with deploying this app in a browser.

## Usage

To use this app, clone the app files into your favorite code editor. Right click index.js, and select Open in Integrated Terminal (or similar command based on your editor). Type <i> node index.js </i> in the terminal and press return. To create your logo, answer each question, and press return after each answer. When all questions are answered, your logo will be generated in a file called <i>logo.svg</i>. Click on the file to see the code, or right-click and view the logo in a browser.

To test the generateLogo.js file, type <i>npm test</i> in the terminal and hit return. All three shapes will return passing tests.


## Challenges

TDD (test driven-development) is hard to wrap your head around-- the idea of creating a test first, that is meant to fail, and then building toward success, is not one I am used to. It made sense eventually, but I had to put a lot of thought into it. The literal nature of the tests (giving the criteria and testing for the criteria in the same function) also makes sense, but takes some getting used to.
